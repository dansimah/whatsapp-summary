# WhatsApp to Telegram Bot with Gemini AI: Project Overview

This document outlines the detailed plan for developing an automated system that bridges communication from WhatsApp groups to a personalized Telegram bot. The core functionality revolves around intelligently processing WhatsApp messages using Google's Gemini AI and providing on-demand summaries and specific information (like homework assignments) via a Telegram interface.

## 1. Motivation

In today's digital age, vital information, especially in school or community groups, can get lost in a deluge of messages. Manually sifting through hundreds of WhatsApp messages to find specific details like homework assignments or important announcements is time-consuming and inefficient. This project aims to solve this problem by leveraging AI to:

* **Automate Information Extraction:** Automatically identify and extract key data points from noisy group chats.

* **Provide On-Demand Summaries:** Offer quick, concise summaries of chat history for specific periods or topics.

* **Centralize Access:** Allow easy querying of this processed information through a convenient Telegram bot, eliminating the need to scour WhatsApp directly.

* **Improve Productivity:** Save significant time and effort for users by streamlining information retrieval.

## 2. Core Features

The system will offer the following primary functionalities:

* **WhatsApp Message Ingestion:**

  * Connect to specified WhatsApp groups (configurable via group names).

  * Capture all new incoming text messages from these groups.

  * Persist message content, sender, group name, and timestamp into a structured database.

* **Database Storage for Messages:**

  * A robust and accessible database will serve as the central repository for all collected WhatsApp messages.

  * This enables historical data lookup, filtering, and efficient querying.

* **Gemini-Powered Message Processing:**

  * Leverage Google's Gemini AI models for advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP).

  * **Summarization:** Generate concise, intelligent summaries of chat conversations for specific periods (e.g., "summarize today's messages in 'Class Announcements' group").

  * **Information Extraction (e.g., Homework):** Identify and extract structured details from messages, such as homework assignments (subject, due date, description), event details, or important announcements.

  * **Classification (Optional but Recommended):** Potentially classify messages into categories (e.g., "Homework," "General Discussion," "Urgent Announcement") to aid retrieval.

* **Telegram Bot Interface:**

  * A user-friendly bot allowing interaction via text commands.

  * **Querying:** Users can ask for specific information (e.g., "What's tomorrow's math homework?").

  * **Summaries:** Users can request summaries for a particular group and date range.

  * **Interactive Responses:** The bot will format and present the processed information clearly and concisely.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

The project will be composed of several interconnected services, designed for modularity and resilience:

+--------------------------+
```

### 3.1. WhatsApp Listener & Message Ingestion Service

* **Role:** The primary data collector. It operates headless, mimicking a WhatsApp Web client.

* **Key Responsibilities:**

    * Initial WhatsApp Web QR code authentication and session persistence.

    * Listening for `message` events in configured groups.

    * Extracting essential message metadata (sender ID, group ID/name, timestamp, raw message text).

    * Persisting this data into the chosen database.

* **Technology Stack:** Node.js, `whatsapp-web.js` library.

### 3.2. Database

* **Role:** The central data store. It provides persistent storage for all WhatsApp messages and enables efficient querying for the Telegram bot.

* **Schema (Example for `messages` table/collection):**

    * `_id` (Primary Key / Unique ID)

    * `waMessageId` (String, unique ID from WhatsApp)

    * `chatId` (String, unique ID of the WhatsApp group/chat)

    * `chatName` (String, display name of the WhatsApp group/chat)

    * `senderId` (String, unique ID of the message sender)

    * `senderName` (String, display name of the message sender)

    * `timestamp` (Date/Number, when the message was sent)

    * `content` (String, the raw text of the message)

    * `isGroup` (Boolean, indicates if from a group chat)

    * `processed` (Boolean, optional, for tracking messages already processed for homework/summaries)

* **Technology Choice:**

    * **SQLite:** Simplest to set up for a personal project (file-based).

    * **PostgreSQL / MongoDB:** More scalable options if considering larger data volumes or complex queries in the future (require separate server processes). We will choose based on ease of integration and self-hosting capabilities.

### 3.3. Telegram Bot Service

* **Role:** The interactive user interface. It acts as the "brain" for responding to user requests.

* **Key Responsibilities:**

    * Connecting to the Telegram Bot API using a provided token.

    * Listening for incoming commands and messages from authorized users.

    * Parsing user commands (e.g., `/summary`, `/homework`).

    * Querying the database for relevant WhatsApp messages based on the command.

    * Sending relevant message data to the Gemini AI for processing (summarization or extraction).

    * Formatting and sending Gemini's response back to the user via Telegram.

* **Technology Stack:** Node.js, `node-telegram-bot-api` library.

### 3.4. Gemini AI Integration

* **Role:** The intelligence layer. It performs advanced NLP tasks on the collected WhatsApp messages.

* **Key Responsibilities:**

    * Receiving raw message text from the Telegram Bot service.

    * Applying carefully crafted "prompts" to Gemini to achieve desired outcomes (e.g., "Summarize these messages:", "Extract homework:").

    * Returning structured (e.g., JSON) or summarized text results.

* **Technology Stack:** Google Gemini API (`googleapis` Node.js client library).

* **Key Point:** We will leverage the **free tier** of the Gemini API. This provides access to powerful models like Gemini 1.5 Flash with generous context windows (e.g., 1 million tokens for Flash), which should be more than sufficient for typical daily chat volumes. Users should be aware that data sent via the free tier may be used by Google for model improvement, as per their terms.

## 4. Key Technologies Overview

* **Node.js:** Backend runtime environment.

* **`whatsapp-web.js`:** Unofficial library for interacting with WhatsApp Web.

* **Database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB):** For persistent message storage.

* **`node-telegram-bot-api`:** Library for building Telegram bots.

* **Google Gemini API (`googleapis`):** For AI-powered text summarization and information extraction.

* **`dotenv`:** For managing environment variables (API keys, tokens).

* **JSON Configuration Files:** For application-specific settings like target WhatsApp groups.

* **Docker & Docker Compose:** For containerization and easy multi-service deployment on a self-hosted environment.

## 5. Configuration Strategy

Configuration will be managed primarily through:

* `.env` file: For sensitive credentials (Gemini API key, Telegram Bot token) that should not be committed to version control.

* `config.json` file: For application-specific settings like the names of WhatsApp groups to monitor for homework or summarization. This allows for clear separation and easy modification without code changes.

## 6. Future Possibilities

* **Advanced Homework Management:** Allowing users to mark homework as "done" or set reminders.

* **User-Specific Summaries:** Tailoring summaries based on user preferences or roles.

* **Multi-User Support:** Implementing user authentication for the Telegram bot to serve multiple individuals securely.

* **Sentiment Analysis:** Using Gemini to analyze the tone of messages.

* **Automated Daily Digests:** Proactive delivery of summaries to Telegram at a scheduled time.

## 7. Important Considerations

* **`whatsapp-web.js` Stability:** As an unofficial library, `whatsapp-web.js` relies on the internal workings of WhatsApp Web and may occasionally break or require updates if WhatsApp changes its web interface.

* **Gemini API Usage:** While the free tier is generous for personal use, large-scale processing or complex prompts could incur costs. Monitoring usage is advisable. Data privacy on the free tier should also be considered.

* **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is crucial for all API calls and database operations to ensure the system remains stable and recovers gracefully from issues.

* **Deployment:** Using Docker Compose will simplify deployment and management on a self-hosted server (e.g., Raspberry Pi, VPS).
